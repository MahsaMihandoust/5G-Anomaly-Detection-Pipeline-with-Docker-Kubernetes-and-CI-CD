## Overview:
This project simulates a real-world 5G network intelligence system, built to detect RAN anomalies (e.g., SINR drop, handover failure) using an end-to-end AI pipeline. It integrates raw KPI log ingestion, scalable processing, machine learning, and automation ‚Äî aligned with telecom industry needs and Open RAN standards.

## üìÅ Dataset
5g_kpis_sample.csv ‚Äì Sample log data from gNodeB/eNodeB with KPIs like RSRP, SINR, handover attempts, throughput.

---

## üöÄ Project Steps & Code Directory

#### 1. Kafka ingestion

Goal: Simulate real-time KPI log ingestion from gNodeB/eNodeB

kafka_producer.py: Reads CSV and sends data row-by-row to a Kafka topic

kafka_consumer.py: Consumes messages and stores them to AWS S3 (raw/ bucket)

---

#### 2. ETL Pyspark

Goal: Clean, transform, and engineer features from raw data

etl_job.py: Reads raw S3 CSV, removes nulls, engineers SINR class, outputs to clean/ S3 zone in Parquet format

---

#### 3. Ml model

Goal: Train and apply IsolationForest to detect anomalies

anomaly_detector.py: Reads cleaned Parquet, fits model, tags anomalies, outputs results to S3 results

---

#### 4. Airflow DAGs

Goal: Orchestrate ETL and ML using Apache Airflow DAGs

etl_ml_pipeline_dag.py: DAG to run ETL, then ML, every hour

---

#### 5. Docker & Kubernetes

Goal: Containerize and deploy the project

Dockerfile: Environment setup for PySpark + ML

k8s_deployment.yaml: Kubernetes deployment and job specs

---

#### 6. CI/CD

Goal: Automate deployment with GitHub Actions

.github/workflows/deploy.yml: Triggers Docker build and Kubernetes redeploy on commit
